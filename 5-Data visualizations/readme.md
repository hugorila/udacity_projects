# Bike Share 2019 - California
## by Hugo Lira


## Dataset

> The dataset is hosted in zip files at gobike website, I decided to analyze only the 2019 data, so I only selected the links for 2019 months. I downloaded and extracted the files programactically.
> The dataset was separeted by months, so I merged the 12 datasets into 1, because of that, I had to drop some columns that were avaliable only in some of the months.
> I also created qualitative columns to help the analysis, like: Duration Interval, Month and Season.

## Summary of Findings

> The most popular seasons are Summer, Spring and Fall;
> There are more users in weekdays than weekends;
> The duration use is greater in the weekends

## Key Insights for Presentation

> To make the visualizations cleaner it was necessaty to filter durations less than 2500 seconds;
> Create new columns in the dataset with informations about season, duration interval and months.
